TrainerEntity is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly.
Abstract classes are meant to be extended by concrete subclasses,
and instances of abstract classes cannot be created.

when Jackson attempts to deserialize the JSON payload into an
instance of TrainerEntity, it fails because it cannot directly
instantiate an abstract class.

TrainerEntity to instantiate during deserialization.
This can be achieved using a custom deserializer.

By implementing a custom deserializer, we can inspect the
discriminator property in the JSON payload (in this case, trainer_type) and determine the appropriate concrete
 subclass of TrainerEntity to instantiate based on the value of the discriminator property.

 annotated the TrainerEntity class with @JsonDeserialize(using = TrainerEntityDeserializer.class),
  Jackson will be able to correctly
 instantiate the appropriate concrete subclass of TrainerEntity during deserialization,
  resolving the InvalidDefinitionException issue.
